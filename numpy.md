# A Quick Introduction to NumPy

**NumPy**, short for Numerical Python, is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.

For more details about the differences and advantages of using NumPy arrays as oposed to Python lists when working with numerical data, see ["What is NumPy?"](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html) from the NumPy documentation.

It is convention to import NumPy under the alias `np` by writing

```python
import numpy as np
```

in the beginning of our Python file.

It is highly recommended that you get familiar with using the official NumPy documentation which can be found [here (link)](https://numpy.org/devdocs/).
